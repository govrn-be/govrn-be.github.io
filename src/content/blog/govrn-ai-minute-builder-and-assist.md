# How GOVRN's AI Features Solve Real Boardroom Pain Points

Modern governance is high-stakes, fast-moving, and often overwhelming. Board Secretaries juggle agendas and minutes under pressure. CEOs must filter critical updates from a flood of information. Directors, especially non-executives, walk into meetings needing instant context—but get PDFs. The result? Strategic blind spots, compliance risks, and wasted time.

GOVRN was built to change that.

## 🎯 Feature 1: AI Minute Builder – Cut Minute Drafting Time by 50%

**Problem:** Board Secretaries often spend **4–6 hours** per meeting compiling, reviewing, and finalizing minutes. They chase clarity, cross-reference discussions, and struggle to ensure accuracy—especially across long or complex sessions.

**Solution:** GOVRN’s AI Minute Builder automates the heavy lifting. It:

- **Records the meeting**
- **Automatically aligns transcripts with agenda items**
- **Suggests structured minutes in real time**
- **Flags inconsistencies or missing items**

> ⏱️ *Result: Minute drafting time slashed by 50%—from hours to minutes.*

This isn't just transcription. It’s smart, contextual documentation that helps secretaries work faster, reduce errors, and stay focused on governance—not admin.

**Who Benefits:**

- **Board Secretaries**: Fewer revisions. Instant structure. Trusted records.
- **CEOs**: Transparent tracking of decisions and follow-ups.
- **Boards**: More reliable documentation, faster.

## 🔒 Feature 2: AI Assist – Ask Questions Inside a Secure Governance Bubble

**Problem:** Directors and executives often need to **query documents mid-meeting**—“Did we approve this before?” “What was our CSRD stance?”—but navigating folders, PDFs, and email threads wastes time and derails focus.

**Solution:** GOVRN’s **AI Assist** answers questions directly from your board materials, within your secure environment.

Ask:

- “What did we decide last time on this?”
- “Which document mentions our ESG targets?”
- “Has this proposal been reviewed by legal?”

**AI Assist finds the answer instantly**, referencing your actual board documents, past minutes, or uploaded policies—without ever leaving the secure governance platform.

> 🔐 *Result: No distractions. No data leaks. Just answers—fast, safe, and in context.*

**Who Benefits:**

- **CEOs & Executives**: Respond swiftly during high-stakes conversations.
- **Directors**: Stay engaged with context-rich information.
- **Compliance Officers**: Minimize risk of off-platform data usage.
