    "Throughout my career serving on multiple boards, I consistently encountered the same challenges: overwhelming document management, inefficient decision-making processes, and the struggle to maintain proper governance standards.",
    "The turning point came during a crucial board meeting where critical documents were misplaced, leading to delayed decisions that impacted the organization's strategic direction. I realized there had to be a better way.",
    "This experience led to the creation of Govrn. We set out to build not just another board portal, but an intelligent platform that truly understands and addresses the complex needs of modern boards.",
    "Today, we're proud to help boards across Europe make better decisions and maintain excellence in governance, powered by cutting-edge AI technology."
