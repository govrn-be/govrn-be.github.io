## What is board structure

The **structure of a corporate board** plays a pivotal role in shaping how a company is directed, controlled, and held accountable. This board structure—whether one-tier, two-tier, or a hybrid—provides the framework for distributing responsibilities and delineating the lines between oversight and management. Understanding these governance models is essential for evaluating board effectiveness and ensuring robust decision-making.

A well-defined board structure also helps organisations respond to increasing regulatory pressure and stakeholder expectations. Investors, employees and regulators all look at how decisions are made, who is accountable and whether oversight is genuinely independent from day-to-day management. The structure of the board is therefore not just a legal formality: it directly influences transparency, control and long-term resilience.

In practice, many organisations do not consciously choose a board structure—they inherit one from their legal form or jurisdiction and rarely revisit whether it still fits their strategy, size or risk profile. Taking a step back to understand the differences between one-tier, two-tier and hybrid models can help leadership teams and shareholders decide whether their current set-up still supports effective governance, or whether adjustments are needed to better align with their objectives.

## One-Tier Board Structure

A **one-tier board** integrates both oversight and management within a single body—typically a *board of directors*. This structure is prevalent in jurisdictions like the **United States, Australia, Sweden, South Africa,** and **Finland**.

### Key Characteristics:
- Includes **executive** and **non-executive** directors.
- The entire board is responsible for **oversight and strategic direction**.
- Commonly features **separation of the Chair and CEO roles** to ensure independent leadership.
- Committees like audit and risk are typically used to support oversight.

This structure supports agile decision-making while demanding strong internal checks to maintain director independence and governance integrity.

### Governance advantages of a one-tier board

A one-tier structure can be highly effective in organisations that value speed and integrated decision-making. Because executive and non-executive directors sit on the same board, information tends to flow quickly and oversight discussions can be closely connected to operational reality. This is particularly useful in dynamic sectors where strategy needs to be reviewed frequently and boards must respond rapidly to market developments, technological shifts or regulatory changes.

The one-tier model also makes it easier to align strategy execution with oversight. Non-executive directors can directly question executives in the same forum, and committees such as audit, risk or remuneration can be used to deepen the level of scrutiny on specific topics without fragmenting the overall governance structure.

### Risks and challenges in one-tier boards

That same proximity between management and oversight can, however, blur the line between the two. If independence is not carefully protected—through a majority of non-executive directors, a separate chair and strong committee structures—the board risks becoming too operational or too aligned with management. This can weaken its ability to challenge assumptions, question performance or intervene early when issues arise.

Conflicts of interest may also be harder to manage when executives participate in discussions that directly affect their own performance, remuneration or succession. Clear protocols on recusal, voting and information sharing are therefore essential in one-tier boards.

### When a one-tier structure works best

One-tier boards tend to work well in companies with relatively concentrated ownership, a straightforward organisational structure and a strong culture of transparency. They are also common in markets where corporate governance codes place significant emphasis on independent directors, board committees and disclosure, which compensate for the structural integration of management and oversight.

## Two-Tier Board Structure

The **two-tier system** distinctly separates management and supervision into two independent boards:
- A **Supervisory Board** oversees and appoints the Management Board.
- A **Management Board** handles day-to-day operations.

Countries like **Germany** and **Indonesia** use this model extensively.

### Features:
- Executives are typically excluded from the Supervisory Board.
- The structure enhances oversight through legal and structural separation.
- Allows for **employee representation** on supervisory boards in some jurisdictions (e.g., Germany).

This system emphasizes clear checks and balances between management and oversight, though it can introduce complexity in communication and strategic alignment.

### Governance strengths of two-tier boards

Two-tier boards provide a clear institutional separation between those who manage the company and those who supervise it. The Supervisory Board focuses on long-term value creation, risk oversight and control of the Management Board, while the latter is responsible for day-to-day operations. This structural distance reinforces independence and can make it easier to challenge management decisions, replace executives or intervene when performance deteriorates.

In many jurisdictions with two-tier systems, the law also embeds employee representation or co-determination in the Supervisory Board. This gives workers a formal voice in governance and can lead to more balanced decision-making on topics such as restructuring, investment and long-term strategy.

### Practical challenges in two-tier structures

The trade-off is that communication between the two boards must be carefully organised. If reporting is slow, incomplete or overly formal, the Supervisory Board may lack insight into the true state of the business. Strategic decisions can also take longer if they require multiple rounds of review and approval across both levels.

Another challenge lies in defining the boundary between “supervision” and “interference”. Supervisory Boards must remain independent without micromanaging the Management Board, which requires clear rules on information requests, meeting frequency and escalation procedures.

### When a two-tier structure is most suitable

Two-tier models are often well suited to large, complex companies with dispersed ownership and strong stakeholder participation. They can be particularly effective in highly regulated sectors or markets that place a premium on formal checks and balances. Organisations that operate across multiple jurisdictions may also favour the two-tier model where local law or listing rules encourage or require it.

## Hybrid Board Structures

Some countries implement **hybrid governance models**, blending elements of both one-tier and two-tier systems. For example:
- **Italy** and **Portugal** allow flexible structures where a board of directors may delegate oversight to a supervisory entity like a board of statutory auditors.

Hybrid boards aim to balance governance efficiency with regulatory rigor, adapting to local legal and corporate cultures.

Hybrid models are attractive for organisations that operate in jurisdictions allowing more flexibility, or that have evolved through mergers, listings or ownership changes. They enable companies to tailor governance to their specific context—for example, by combining a unitary board of directors with a separate statutory audit body, or by appointing independent oversight roles that function alongside the main board.

Because hybrid structures can be highly customised, they require particular attention to clarity. Decision rights, reporting lines and oversight responsibilities must be defined explicitly to avoid gaps or overlaps. Without such clarity, hybrid systems risk becoming more complex without delivering proportional governance benefits.

When designed thoughtfully, however, hybrid boards can offer a pragmatic balance between agility and control, allowing organisations to respect local legal requirements while adopting governance practices that fit their strategy and stakeholder landscape.

## Strategic Implications

Board structure directly impacts:
- **Risk oversight**
- **Strategic agility**
- **Information flow**
- **Director accountability**

Choosing or evolving a board structure should align with a company's governance goals, legal context, and stakeholder expectations.

A company’s strategic direction also plays a critical role in determining whether its board structure remains appropriate over time. As organisations expand into new markets, acquire businesses or undergo significant digital transformation, their governance needs often shift as well. A structure that once supported agility may gradually become too informal, while a framework designed for stability may eventually limit strategic responsiveness. Periodically reassessing the board model ensures that governance continues to serve—not hinder—the organisation’s evolution.

Board structure also shapes how effectively directors can oversee emerging risks. Topics such as cybersecurity, sustainability, data privacy and supply-chain resilience require deeper expertise and more frequent interaction with management. The right structure can help clarify which committees or oversight bodies should take the lead, how information is escalated and how responsibilities are distributed without duplication.

Finally, structure influences the board’s relationship with its wider stakeholder environment. Investors may expect stronger independence and checks and balances, while founders or family owners may prioritise a more integrated governance model. Regulators, employees and long-term partners may each have different expectations around transparency and oversight. Ensuring that the chosen structure reflects these needs helps reinforce trust and supports more predictable decision-making across the organisation.

## Conclusion

Understanding **board structures in corporate governance** is more than a compliance issue—it's a strategic consideration that affects the effectiveness, accountability, and long-term sustainability of an organization. Whether a company adopts a one-tier, two-tier, or hybrid model, the ultimate goal remains the same: to create a governance system that enables responsible, informed, and ethical decision-making.

As organisations evolve, regularly reassessing board structure becomes essential. Changes in ownership, regulatory expectations, organisational complexity or strategic priorities can all influence whether the existing governance model remains fit for purpose. A structure that once offered clarity and balance may need refinement over time to maintain effective oversight.

Strong governance also depends on the board’s ability to adapt and learn. Periodic evaluations, transparent role definitions and well-designed information flows help ensure that the chosen structure supports—not constrains—the board’s strategic contribution. Whether operating within a one-tier, two-tier or hybrid model, boards benefit from revisiting how responsibilities are distributed and how decisions are escalated across the organisation.

Ultimately, thoughtful attention to board structure strengthens accountability, improves transparency and supports long-term organisational resilience. By aligning structure with strategy and stakeholder expectations, boards are better equipped to guide the organisation through both stability and change.
